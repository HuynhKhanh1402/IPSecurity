  # Note:
  # - You can also use section such as author, footer, image, thumbnail in the message to override the default message values
  # - You can use colors in two formats: hexadecimal color code (#FFFFFF) and hexadecimal converted to decimal.
  #     Ex: "#00FF00" (GREEN) or 65280 = #00FF00 because when you convert #00FF00 to decimal, it becomes 65280
  #     See https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html to convert
